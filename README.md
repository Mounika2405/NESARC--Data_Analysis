# NESARC-Data_Analysis

NESARC (U.S. National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions) is a survey designed to determine the magnitude of alcohol use and psychiatric disorders in the U.S. population.

In this project, different questions have been addressed by first analysing relationships between different variables and then confirming these relationships using hypothesis testing techniques implemented in Python.

For more details, read my article on hypothesis testing.
